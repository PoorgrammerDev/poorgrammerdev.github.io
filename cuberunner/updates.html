        <!-- BETA 1.3 -->
        <h4 class="update-title">Beta 1.3</h4>
        <h6 class="update-subtitle">May 7, 2021</h6>
        <h6>Gameplay</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Upgrade System has been added.
                <ul>
                    <li>Every power-up can now be upgraded.</li>
                    <li>Upgrades cost Bits and enhance the power-up's abilities.</li>
                    <li>Most power-ups (all except for Decimate and Align) have two distinct paths to choose from.</li>
                    <li>Every path has four levels of upgrade.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some balance changes to the difficulties' values.
                <ul>
                    <li>Most notable: Impossible difficulty is now slower, but obstacles are packed more densely.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Technical</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Binary save system has been added.
                <ul>
                    <li>Saves are now stored in a .dat file instead of using the built-in Unity PlayerPrefs.</li>
                    <li>This fixes the issue that caused the stats to reset on game version update when playing the browser version. Desktop was and still is unaffected.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unfortunately, old stats from Beta 1.2 browser version will not carry over as it is still on the old PlayerPrefs system, but everything Beta 1.3 onward will.</li>
                            <li>Please note, due to how the system works, that clearing browser cache will still clear the save files for the browser version! Again, the desktop version is unaffected.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Changed Bits to have sphere colliders.</li>
            <li>Made the Bits sound effect quieter.</li>
            <li>Fixed a mostly unknown bug with row distance calculation which may have caused some moves to be impossible.</li>
            <li>Fixed button click sound effects not working for browser version.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused the player to sometimes physically collide with Bits.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused the default difficulty to be Normal in the Main Menu, but Easy while running.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

                <ul>
                    <li>The sole feature was an indicator on the top right corner to reveal the upcoming power-up, since they

        <!-- BETA 1.1 -->
        <h4 class="update-title">Beta 1.1</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>An in-game currency to be picked up during runs. Uses for this are coming soon.</li>
                    <li>Bits spawn in various patterns on the field, and can be picked up by running into it.</li>
                    <li>Harder difficulties have a higher chance of spawning Bits, and they are also worth more when picked up.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Currently, the multipliers are:

                                    <li>Impossible: x4</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>On Desktop, pressing [Esc] during a run now brings up the pause menu.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Please note that while this works in the Web version, it is overridden when in fullscreen.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>On Desktop, pressing [Space] in the menu now starts the game.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>Changes</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Hardened has been rebalanced.
                <ul>
                    <li>Now has a time limit before it expires. Activates instantly upon pick-up.</li>
                    <li>When impacting between two obstacles, Hardened now works properly.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before, the shield would absorb one impact, but the other would cause the game to end.</li>
                            <li>This was actually a bug, not intended behavior.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The UI color for Hardened has also been changed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Score has now been replaced with 'Distance'
                <ul>
                    <li>Measured in meters</li>
                    <li>Before, Score increased independently of the speed. Rather, it depended on a separate variable per
                        difficulty.</li>
                    <li>Now, Distance is entirely dependent on the forward speed of the player.</li>
                    <li>It also increases notably faster than the previous Score system.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Game Progression has been tweaked in response to the new Distance system
                <ul>
                    <li>Game Progression is in charge of speeding up the run as it goes.</li>
                    <li>Hopefully there is little to no difference visible to the player.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h6>Bugs Fixed</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where pausing the game as Time Dilation ended would yield in the game resuming while paused.</li>
            <li>Hardened can now absorb multiple simultaneous impacts. (See the Hardened entry under Changes for more info.)
            </li>
            <li>Fixed an audio bug with the Power-up pickup sound.</li>
            <li>Fixed a graphical bug with the Photosensitvity warning.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
